# 🏥 Clinic Scheduling & Waitlist Engine

A backend scheduling system for managing clinic appointments with strict overlap prevention, validation, and RESTful APIs.

Built using **Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Flyway, and JPA**, this project simulates a production-style backend service for handling medical appointment scheduling.

The system ensures that **clinicians cannot be double-booked**, supports **pagination and filtering**, and provides **structured API error handling**.

# 🚀 Features

## Appointment Scheduling
- Create appointments for patients with clinicians
- Prevent overlapping appointments for the same clinician
- Validate time ranges and input data
- Automatically generate unique appointment IDs (UUID)

## Advanced API Capabilities
- Pagination for large appointment datasets
- Filtering appointments by clinician or patient
- Structured JSON error responses
- DTO-based API responses (no entity leakage)

## Database & Persistence
- PostgreSQL relational database
- Flyway database migrations
- JPA / Hibernate ORM mapping
- Connection pooling with HikariCP

## Production-style backend practices
- Layered architecture
- Global exception handling
- Integration testing
- RESTful API design

# 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a standard **layered backend architecture**:

Controller Layer │ ▼ Service Layer (business logic) │ ▼ Repository Layer (Spring Data JPA) │ ▼ PostgreSQL Database


### Key Components

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Controller | Handles HTTP requests and responses |
| Service | Business logic and validation |
| Repository | Database access using JPA |
| Domain | Core entities (Appointment, Patient, Clinician) |
| DTO | Clean API response models |
| Exception Handler | Centralised API error responses |

# 📡 API Endpoints

## Create Appointment

POST /appointments


Example request:

```json
{
  "patientName": "Alice Johnson",
  "clinicianName": "Dr Smith",
  "startTime": "2026-03-20T10:00:00",
  "endTime": "2026-03-20T10:30:00",
  "fee": 75.00
}

Example response:

{
  "id": "9b5d1c21-3b44-4d1a-9a20-cc2d97fa87a1",
  "patientName": "Alice Johnson",
  "clinicianName": "Dr Smith",
  "startTime": "2026-03-20T10:00:00",
  "endTime": "2026-03-20T10:30:00",
  "fee": 75.00
}


Get All Appointments
Supports pagination.

GET /appointments?page=0&size=10


Filter Appointments
Filter by clinician:

GET /appointments?clinicianName=Dr Smith

Filter by patient:

GET /appointments?patientName=Alice Johnson


Get Appointment by ID

GET /appointments/{id}


Delete Appointment

DELETE /appointments/{id}


❌ Error Handling
The API returns structured error responses when requests fail.
Example:

{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-19T10:12:34",
  "message": "Appointment overlaps with an existing appointment"
}

Errors are handled centrally via the GlobalExceptionHandler.

🔄 Database Migrations
The project uses Flyway for versioned schema migrations.
Example migrations:

V1__create_appointments_table.sql
V2__add_fee_to_appointments.sql

Flyway automatically applies migrations at application startup.

🧪 Testing
Integration tests verify:
Appointment creation
Overlap prevention
API endpoints
Database persistence
Example test class:

AppointmentControllerIntegrationTest

Run tests with:

mvn test


▶️ Running the Project Locally
1. Clone repository

git clone https://github.com/asahal7/Clinic-Scheduling-System.git

2. Start PostgreSQL
Create the database:

CREATE DATABASE clinic_db;

3. Configure application.properties
Example configuration:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/clinic_db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
spring.flyway.enabled=true

4. Run the application

mvn spring-boot:run

Server starts at:

http://localhost:8080
